    """
    A class that provides buffered writing functionality to a file.

    Attributes:
        filename (str): The name of the file to write to.
        buffer_size (int): The maximum number of lines to buffer before writing to the file.
        buffer (list): The buffer that holds the lines to be written.

    Methods:
        write(line): Appends a line to the buffer. If the buffer is full, it flushes the buffer to the file.
        flush(): Writes the contents of the buffer to the file.
        close(): Flushes the buffer and closes the file.
